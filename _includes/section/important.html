                    <h1>How Axal Tokenomics Work?</h1>
                    <p>     
                    The Axal tokenomics model is a comprehensive system designed to 
                    facilitate various aspects of life and operations within an eco-village. 
                    It utilizes a token-based approach to manage and incentivize activities 
                    related to sustainability, energy production, community participation, and more. 
                    Here's an overview of how it works:

                    <p>
                        Tokens are created to represent the renewable energy generated within the eco-village. Residents can use these tokens to access electricity, or they can be traded, promoting energy sustainability and independence.
