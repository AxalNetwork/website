Our model uses solar panels on vertical farming greenhouses, dual-purposing them as a sustainable power source for pivotal IT operations like crypto and web server data centres, and as a vital contributor to agricultural sustainability. Expertly redirecting server-generated heat, we nurture crops in winter and produce dried goods in summer, establishing a continually reciprocal cycle between technological and agricultural productivity. Partner with Axal, where your IT infrastructure not only functions impeccably but also substantively supports and advances environmental and agricultural prosperity.'
